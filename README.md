# Assignment 1
## Introduction
The goal of this repo is to implement the following algorithms, and
compare their performance results.  Namely, we will discuss the 
implementation, error rates (and calculations), and general usefulness
of each algorithms.

## Algorithms implemented
1.  Decision Trees (with some form of pruning)
    -  Will incorporate the ID3 search algorithm for determining nodes
2.  Neural Networks
3.  Boosting
4.  Support Vector Machines
5.  k-nearest neighbors

## Report format
LaTeX

## How to run the programs in this file
Each Algorithm's implementation is stored 

## Deliverables
1.  a file named README.txt containing instructions for running your code (see note below)  
2.  your code (see note below)  
3.  A file named yourgtaccount-analysis.pdf containing your writeup  
4.  any supporting files you need, such as your training and test sets (see note below).  
Note below: if the data are way, way, too huge for submitting, see if you can arrange for an URL. This also goes for code, too. Submitting all of Weka isn't necessary, for example, because I can get it myself; however, you should at least submit any files you found necessary to change and enough support and explanation so we could reproduce your results if we really wanted to do so. In any case, include all the information in README.txt

## Further reading
Most of the theoretical foundations were laid out in the CS7641 lectures
as well as the Thomas Mitchel Machine Learning (1997) textbook.
